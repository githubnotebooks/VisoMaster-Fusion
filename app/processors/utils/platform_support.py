"""Execution-provider capability detection.

VisoMaster Fusion targets Windows/Linux with NVIDIA hardware, where the
TensorRT and CUDA execution providers are always assumed present. macOS has
neither, so every code path that hard-codes ``"cuda"`` needs a way to ask what
this machine can actually do.

This module is the single source of truth for that question. It reports the
execution providers that are genuinely usable here (in priority order) and maps
each one to the torch device the rest of the pipeline should run tensors on.

Provider names are the user-facing strings stored in
``control["ProvidersPrioritySelection"]`` and matched in
``ModelsProcessor.update_provider_configuration``.
